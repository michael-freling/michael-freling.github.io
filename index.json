Besides, I couldn't figure out how to sign in by Google before implementing a test case.\nCompare to use jest for a browser testings, cypress component testings are useful not to install and set up many of modules for jest, and easier to emulator DOM events.\nThere are a few things that I need to look into when I implemented component testings.\nCypress doesn't support [multiple tabs](https:// docs.cypress.io/guides/references/trade-offs#Multiple-tabs). For handling the URL parameters of a next.js, there is a react router. Testings GraphQL resolvers with TypeGraphQL by Jest How to set up jest for Next.js application is described in the Next.js official document. But I just used it for server side testings, so I didn't install @testing-library/react nor @testing-library/jest-dom.\nTo use TypeGraphQL, it requires to set up a few things\nFor TypeScript configurations First, install a few packages\n1npm install --save-dev @types/jest ts-jest ts-node Then update jest.config.ts to next. Note that preset will be updated later.\n1+ import { pathsToModuleNameMapper } from \u0026#34;ts-jest\u0026#34;; 2+ const { compilerOptions } = require(\u0026#34;./tsconfig\u0026#34;); 3 4const customJestConfig = { 5 // Add more setup options before each test is run 6 // setupFilesAfterEnv: [\u0026#34;\u0026lt;rootDir\u0026gt;/jest.setup.js\u0026#34;], 7 // if using TypeScript with a baseUrl set to the root directory then you need the below for alias\u0026#39; to work 8+ preset: \u0026#34;ts-jest\u0026#34;, 9+ moduleNameMapper: pathsToModuleNameMapper(compilerOptions.paths), 10 moduleDirectories: [\u0026#34;node_modules\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026lt;rootDir\u0026gt;/\u0026#34;], 11 // testEnvironment: \u0026#34;jest-environment-jsdom\u0026#34;, 12}; Enable to use async and await on jest files Just following this document.\nAt first, use --experimental-vm-modules option on node to start a jest.\n1- jest --watch 2+ node --no-warnings --experimental-vm-modules node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js --watch Then use default-esm preset in jest.config.ts.\n1- \u0026#34;preset\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ts-jest\u0026#34;, 2+ \u0026#34;preset\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ts-jest/presets/default-esm\u0026#34;, For TypeGraphQL For type-graphql, import reflect-metadata has to be imported before running test cases. Add a line to import it on jest.setup.ts loaded on setupFilesAfterEnv.\nError: jest is not defined An error jest is not defined occured when I tried to use jest.setTimeout function.\nAdd import { jest } from \u0026quot;@jest/global\u0026quot;; to solve this, which is discussed in this comment.\nGet a file path for a fixture file To get a fixture file from the relative path of the test file, use path.resolve and url.fileURLToPath\n1import path from \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;; 2import { fileURLToPath } from \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;; 3 4path.resolve( 5 path.dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)), 6 \u0026#34;../../fixtures/video.mp4\u0026#34; 7); For firebase of jest If firebase-admin/auth is used, there was an error like next.

This is also from this github issue.\nFIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST FIREBASE_STORAGE_EMULATOR_HOST Suggest jest functions by VSCode with Cypress Suggest jet functions of test files didn't work correctly with Cypress. It's because chai functions are installed by Cypress and they are suggested. And this was not a bug but a configuration issue, and other person also reported in the GitHub issue.\nFor my case, I put every jest test cases into __tests__ directory, so define tsconfig.json in the directory and define typeAcquisition to include jest\n1{ 2 \u0026#34;extends\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;../tsconfig.json\u0026#34;, 3 \u0026#34;typeAcquisition\u0026#34;: { 4 \u0026#34;include\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;jest\u0026#34;] 5 }, 6 \u0026#34;include\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;**/*.ts\u0026#34;] 7} Containers for MySQL and Firebase emulators Run a MySQL as a container Use Docker Compose to build a MySQL container. In order to initialize a schema for this application, prisma is used to manage initiailze schemas. To access a different MySQL container when jest runs, prepare a different env file and mount it to .env file on prisma container.\nRun a Firebase emulator as a container Build an image for a firebase emulator as a container. I set up by simple Dockerfile like next.\n1FROM node:18.2 2 3EXPOSE 4000 4EXPOSE 9099 5EXPOSE 9199 6 7RUN npm install -g firebase-tools 8 9RUN apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; apt install -y default-jre 10 11ENTRYPOINT [ \u0026#34;firebase\u0026#34; ] And in order to access the container from the host, add host: 0.0.0.0 to firebase.json by following a few comments like this or this.\n1{ 2 \u0026#34;storage\u0026#34;: { 3 \u0026#34;rules\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;storage.rules\u0026#34; 4 }, 5 \u0026#34;emulators\u0026#34;: { 6 \u0026#34;auth\u0026#34;: { 7 \u0026#34;port\u0026#34;: 9099, 8+ \u0026#34;host\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0.0.0.0\u0026#34; 9 }, 10 \u0026#34;storage\u0026#34;: { 11 \u0026#34;port\u0026#34;: 9199, 12+ \u0026#34;host\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0.0.0.0\u0026#34; 13 }, 14 \u0026#34;ui\u0026#34;: { 15 \u0026#34;enabled\u0026#34;: true, 16+ \u0026#34;host\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0.0.0.0\u0026#34; 17 } 18 } 19} GitHub Actions Cypress component testings Follow this setup on GitHub Actions to run cypress component testings.\nDocker layer caches of GitHub Actions There is an article to cache docker images by a Dockerfile. But in order to cache docker layer images for a docker compose, it's required to use a different way. And there is another GitHub Action to do so. I just used it to cache them.\nErrors during eslint Functions naming useXXX even on a server side is recognized as a React hook and made an error.\n1334:5 Error: React Hook \u0026#34;useGenericAuth\u0026#34; cannot be called at the top level.

See this StackExchange answer for more details. To hide a mesh in an edit mode, H: To hide the selected mesh Shift H: To hide everything but the selected mesh Alt H: To unhide everything This information is from this article. This is useful to edit meshes that are complicated. Change a mesh using another mesh We can select faces from the shape of another object using Knife Project. Note that how to use seems to be changed in some point, probably Blender 2.8.\nSelect an object you want to change Go to \u0026quot;Edit Mode\u0026quot; Select another object to cut Select Mesh \u0026gt; Knife Project The faces of the object will be selected on the object. Cut the face or extrude it as you like See next video for how to use Knife project.\nKnife project cannot be used with a Link collection.\nLight Light is an invisible object in Blender to emit lights.\nWorkaround to apply modifiers Modifiers cannot be applied to Light objects directly, like Array or Mirror. In order to apply them, use Faces of Instancing.\nCreate new meash like a face Make the mesh a parent of a lamp Select the mesh and go to Properties Editor \u0026gt; Object Properties \u0026gt; Instaning and select Faces Add a Modifier like Array into the mesh. Then the lamp should be created on each duplicated mesh You can see more details in next video.\nMaterials Basics In order to assign a different material on the face of a mesh from the other faces, go to Edit Mode, select the face, and assign the material. Use cases Make a glass material In order to make a glass material like a window, it looks we can do by setting these things.\nEnable alpha-based transparency Go to Material \u0026gt; Settings \u0026gt; Blend Mode Select something like Alpha Blend. Use Transparent BSDF Node. This is to show objects inside a glass material in Object Mode. Open Shading workspace In Shader Editor Add Transparent BSDF node Add Mix Shader node Connect Shader of Mix Shader to the Surface of Material Output Connect two Shader of Mix Shader to the BSDF of Transparent BSDF and Principled BSDF Set glass like properties. This is to change a material like a glass and also show images outside of the glass. Go to Material \u0026gt; Surface Set Transmission to 1 or close to it. Set Roughness as you like See following materials for more details\nBlender Knowledgebase: Basic Alpha Transparency StackExchange: Glass: Increase \u0026quot;Transmission Roughness\u0026quot; as the object behind goes far Blender 3.0 Manual: Principled BSDF Images Troubleshootings How to find missing texture files and update them? Go to File \u0026gt; External Data \u0026gt; Find missing files and select a correct directory for texture files.\nThis solution is from this answer in Stack Exchange.\nHow to remove images completely from a blender file? Even if you delete a material using an image file, it can still be selected on a Mateiral. In order to delete it completely, Go to Outliner Editor \u0026gt; Orphan Data Display Mode. Then delete images you want, or click Purge to delete every data, including images.\nThis solution is from this answer in Stack Exchange, and there is an image in the answer.\n3D animation During 3D animation, a 3D model keeps changing temporarily. There are mainly 2 ways to achieve this, using bones or shape keys. Bones are objects while shape keys aren't.\nBasics with bones,\nIn order to add an object into your Timeline Editor, choose an object, right click, and click to _Insert Keyframe and select one of them like Location and Rotation. Set a parent into an object Click a child object and then click a parent object Select Object \u0026gt; Parent \u0026gt; Object Now you can see the child object under the parent object in the Outliner editor. You can see the details of parent objects in the manual. To animate objects based on an arbitary axis instead of the world origin, the origin of an object can be updated. Select an object you wanna change the axis Go to Edit Mode Select Mesh \u0026gt; Snap \u0026gt; Cursor to Selected Go to Object mode Select Object \u0026gt; Set Origin \u0026gt; Origin to 3D Cursor Now the object will move, rotate, or scale based on the 3D cursor you set. In order to move the 3D cursor back, Object \u0026gt; Snap \u0026gt; Cursor to World Origin. This is from the answer of StackExchange. There is a way to update the default configuration for orbit around under Edit \u0026gt; Preference \u0026gt; Navigation \u0026gt; Orbit and Pan and turn on Orbit Around Selection. But I couldn't rotate an object from another object using this configuration. Basics with shape keys\nIn order to animate a model using shape keys, go to Dope Sheet Editor \u0026gt; Shape Key Editor Mode\nIn order to control shape keys by bones, use Drivers. See next video for more details for how to configure. Briefly explaning,\nGo to Object Data Properties \u0026gt; Shape Keys and right cilck the value of a shape key. Choose \u0026quot;Add Driver\u0026quot; to add the driver for the shape key. Edit property like Object, Bone, Type, or Space They can be also edited on Drivers Editor \u0026gt; Drivers tool menu See this article for more details about shape keys.\nRigging During pose mode, to reset all poses, select Pose \u0026gt; Clear Transform \u0026gt; All. Action Action is a way to reuse a specific animation of one object. There are two important editors to\nDope Sheet \u0026gt; Action Editor mode: To edit an action itself. It's better to start an action from 1st frame Nonlinear Animation: To use multiple actions, animate a scene To understand an action, see next informative video for how to use Action.\nThere are a few important things to use Action\nTo change the speed of an action, go to Strip \u0026gt; Action Clip and set the \u0026quot;Playback Scale\u0026quot; value To repeat an action multiple times, go to Strip \u0026gt; Action Clip and set the \u0026quot;Repeat\u0026quot; value Questions to me is\nCan an action be created for multiple objects? - It looks no. Is there any way to combine actions of multiple objects and use them? - I cannot find it. If one action starts from the locations of the end of another action No smart way. Some people recommended to use Delta transform in this answer or this answer. Camera In order to switch Active Camera during animation, makers are helpful.\nIn the timeline, add a marker by Marker \u0026gt; Add Marker Select a camera you want to activate Select Marker \u0026gt; Bind Camera to Markers to set a camera on your animation scene Output Go to Properties Editor \u0026gt; Output Properties \u0026gt; Output and change outputs to\nFile Format Container Video Codec Audio Codec See this answer for more details.\nIn order to view rendering result, go to Image Editor and see Render Result. Or Render \u0026gt; Render animation to output your animation. If rendering result turns out pure black, then something might be wrong, like in a Composition Editor, Render Layers doesn't connect to Composite Node.\nSee these answers for more details.\nPossible causes for blank output on rendering Render turns black when finished. Multiple scenes On Blender, multiple scenes can be created from a menu bar.\nTo animate and switch the scenes,\nCreate another Scene Use Video Editing Layout or Video Sequencer Editor Add each scenes on the Sequencer view To make a better transition on each scenes\nSelect multiple scenes' strips on Sequencer Go to Add \u0026gt; Transition and choose a Transition suits for your animation, like Cross However, there is a bug at least on v3.0 to use other scenes. That is when there are multiple strips of the same scene but different input, camera and sequencer, it doesn't play any audio. This is a bug report in Blender.\nWorking on multiple blender files In order to share materials from other blender files, use Link or Append. It's better to import Collection from an blender file instead of Objects.\nLink: Creates a reference to the data. When an original file is changed, the imported data by Link is also updated If objects are imported, they cannot be change the location, rotation, or scale. But if collections are imported, they can In order to reload the new changes of a source blender file, go to Outliner Editor \u0026gt; Blender File Display Mode, right click a link file, and select \u0026quot;Reload\u0026quot;. Append: Make a full copy of data. Unlike Link, the imported data isn't updated when an original file is updated See next video for how to use Link and Append.\nAnd in order to edit bones for linked models, select the object and go to Object \u0026gt; Relations \u0026gt; Make Library Override. Then the bones can be edited and the model can be animated. For the details of Library Overrides, see an official manual.\nHowever, a few things cannot be edited. For example, it looks Materials cannot be updated directly, though for some properties of Materials like color, there is a workaround.\nExamples Door Modeling There are a few things to consider before modeling a door\nThe aspect ratio: According to this article, most of doors have either of following aspect ratios: Two squares: 1:2 Golden proportion: 1:1.61 Swing direction: A door is designed differently if it's for a right hand or left hand as well as it is opened to an inward or outward direction. See this article for each case. Handle I checked this video to see how to make a model\nIf you can't choose a Single Vert mesh, go to Edit \u0026gt; Preferences \u0026gt; Add-ons and enable \u0026quot;Add Mesh: Extra Objects\u0026quot; at first Design a handle using vertexes, so the shape will not be of cylinders. Select Add \u0026gt; Mesh \u0026gt; Single Vert \u0026gt; Add Single Vert and add the mesh Extrude the mesh to change the shape of a handle you wanna design Note that it has to be Vertex select mode, not Edge select nor Face select mode to see extrude vertexes From vertexes, convert them into the set of cylinders Change the mode to Object mode and select Object \u0026gt; Convert \u0026gt; Curve Go to Properties Editor \u0026gt; Object Data Properties \u0026gt; Geometry \u0026gt; Bevel and Increase the Depth Increase the Resolution Edit the handle as a mesh and complete modeling Select the curve and then Object \u0026gt; Convert \u0026gt; Mesh I checked this slide or this video.\nBoard See this article for each step.\nAnimation Parent objects are important to rotate The handle must be a child of the main board The mainboard should rotate around one of the edge. There should be an object for the edge so that it can be rotated around it Character Lip sync There are multiple addons for Lip sync.\n[Blender Market: Syncnix: Blender Lip Sync Action](https://blendermarket.com/products/syncnix $5 to buy GitHub: Blender Rhubarb Lip Sync Requires software Rhubarb Requires 9 mouth positions in a pose library Uses a sound file and an optional script file for an animation. It's recommended to use a script file GitHub: io_import_lipSync-blender2.8 Requires software Papagayo-NG Requires mouth positions in a pose library, and there are rules for the names of each pose and the pose library Use Papagayo to generate a dat file I used Rhubarb Lip Sync addon because it's free and also it's easier to use than Papagayo.\nRhubarb Lip Sync This addon requires a pose library as of January 2022. In order to animate a model by shape keys, drivers of shape keys with bones have to be set. See next video for how to.\nTroubleshootings If you face an issue and couldn't see any messages on the Blender, a blender should start from CLI like Windows Powershell in order to figure out what happens.\nPS C:\\path\u0026gt; blender.exe The file format isn't supported The audio file format must be either of a wav or ogg.\nIf you start a Blender from Powershell and try to read an audio file other than the above two formats, you can see an error message like next.\n{ \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;start\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;file\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\Recording.m4a\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;log\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;level\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Info\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Application startup.

I already wrote some posts to make this video for practice, so I just referred those posts on some scenes. But this is the first time to use AE, so there can be better ways to do.\nChat screen There is another post for how to do a chat animation scene.\nRain scene There is another post for raining scene. But there were a few things that I didn't describe in the post but I tried on the videos.\nRain drops on a window and its frame should be shown differently Words on window and its frame should be shown differently In both of cases, Luma matte can be used. Luma matte, which is one of Track Matte, can expose only specific places of an image, and expose its luminance value, which is a numeric value for light from RGB, , For more details, this page clearly explains them.\nIn my video, I created pre-composition for text layers. And it is used by following ways:\nDuplicate window frame image layer Duplicate the pre-composition layer Put the pre-composition layer below the window frame image layer Set Luma Matte for Track Matte to the pre-composition on the text layer I was able to do the same thing for rain drops layer.\nImprovements Because I used Luma matte for rain drops, I couldn't animate rain drops to stuck on the top of frame side. Currently, if rain drops reaches window frame, then it stil drops behind the frame. Those rain drops cannot be seen because the frame but it will appear after it passes the frame. I wanted to stuck them, drop on the frame with different speed, and then drop again on the window, but I couldn't figure out how.\nRotate text In order to rotate a text, I learned how to do on next video.\nAdd a text layer Add a mask on which the text wants to move on the text layer Set Text \u0026gt; Path Options \u0026gt; Path to the Mask on the text layer Enable Text \u0026gt; Path Options \u0026gt; Reverse Path when we want to change the direction and position in a opposite way To animate a text, change Text \u0026gt; Path Options \u0026gt; First Margin gradually on the timeline Reverse text screen Set scale negative value for x axis. Then it shows a text backward.\nText shadow In a text layer, we can only set one stroke, but sometimes we wanna show other color as an outer stroke again. In that case, we can use Perspective \u0026gt; Drop Shadow effect.\nAudio spectrum I wrote a different post describing audio spectrum.\nBlack noise Use Fractal noise effect on the duplicated image layer. And change Fractal Noise \u0026gt; Evolution Options \u0026gt; Random Seed values on the timeline for animation.\nTo add a black noise on a specific image or on a specific layer Duplicate the image on which black noise wants to show Add Effects \u0026amp; Presets \u0026gt; Noise \u0026amp; Gain \u0026gt; Fractal Noise to the layer To animate the noise, Change Fractal Noise \u0026gt; Evoluion Options \u0026gt; Random Seed on the timeline The same thing was performed with Noise or Turbulent Noise instead of Fractal Noise, but Fractal Noise could be the best in my case.\nOld film tape I wrote an other post differently for old film tape effect.\nRotate randomly In the 2nd interlude, in my video, audio spectrums rotates randomly. I use noise function to make it smoothly rotate. There are other functions like random, but it rotates too fast in the scene and I couldn't figure out how to rotate slower using those functions. I did next changes:\nMake the audio spectrums layer to 3D\nChange X, Y, and Z rotation transform properties to following expressions. Note that SPEED is something you want to change the rotation speed. if it's bigger number, it rotates slower. In my video, I set 2 on one spectrum and 5 on another.\nSPEED=2 seedRandom(index) transform.xRotation + 360*noise(time/SPEED) Transit scenes like closing eyes In my video, animation for closing eyes actually does\nChange the background from white to black, with a wipe transition Remove an effect to reduce a saturation on a layer if the background is white At first, I thought Effects \u0026amp; Presets \u0026gt; Animation Presets \u0026gt; Transition - Wipes \u0026gt; Iris - round can be used but because of 2nd bullet point and the transition is reverse direction, I couldn't do it. So, instead, I created 2 separate layers and animate separately but it behaves like the same way.\n1. Change the background from white to black This is very easy. I created a shape layer, render circle with white fill color, and cover the entire composition. And change the size on the timeline for animation to make it zero gradually. Also, under this shape layer, create a solid layer with black color, so once the shape on the shape layer is gone, the background becomes black.\n2. Animate mask on the Adjustment layer for its effect In order to remove an effect on the layer, I used Mask and change the size of Mask gradually on its timeline. I got this idea from next video, and also there is an article to animate masks.\nIn my video, I did\nAdd an Adjustment Layer Add Hue/Saturation effect to the Layer Add a Mask on the Adjustment layer, and added Ellipse exactly the same size as the shaper layer created on the above This mask Set the size of the Ellipse on timeline exactly the same way as the shape layer created above Other resources I use these web sites to check previews of each animation and see whether there is a good effect.\nPreview Gallery for each transition Preview Gallery of each text animation ","link":"https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/07/17/after-effects-what-i-did-to-make-fan-made-mv-for-about-me-/-suisei-hoshimachi-cover/","title":"After Effects: What I did to make fan made MV for about me / Suisei Hoshimachi cover"},{"body":"This post is written using After Effects 2021.\nI wanted to show an animation like old tape films, and made the next video. In this video, I noted how I did it.\nIn fact, I noticed there are some plugins like motionarray, but I hadn't known before I made it. So, we might be able to do the same thing by easier way with them.\nBesides, there is an article for describe how to repeat objects in AE. I use Repeater learned from this article, and didn't try other ways but might be worth trying.\nOld film effects First of all, I made a pre-composition to animate several scenes, without old film tapes.\nThen using the pre-composition, I edited another composotion to show an old film tape.\nOld film tape Like next video, I made the old film tape effect.\nThere are multiple ellipses on the above and below of each scene, and in order to show the same ellipses multiple times, Repeater for a Shape layer can be used. These are steps to make those ellipses.\nAdd a Shape layer and render an ellipse in it Click Add on the side of Shape Layer \u0026gt; Contents, and select Repeater Change Repeater \u0026gt; Copies to add or remove the number of ellipses Change Repeater \u0026gt; Transform: Repeater \u0026gt; Position to expand intervals between each ellipse Then do the same thing to show other side Repeat a film screen The above step only repeats eillipses, and in order to repeat pre-compositions, Motion Tiles can be used. I tried and these are what I did\nAdd Stylize \u0026gt; Motion Tile to the pre-composition I made on the above steps Change Effects \u0026gt; Motion Tile \u0026gt; Output Width to repeat screen horizontally. I chose (odd number) * 100, like 700 or 900. It looks how Output Width works if it is: 100: show 1 screen 200: show 1 screen and 0.5 on the left and 0.5 on the right 300: show 3 screens Change Transform \u0026gt; Position of the pre-composition to move the repeated pre-composition. Then we can make an animation like the video on the top of this page.\nThere is a limitation of Motion Tiles, though, that it cannot exceed 30,000 pixels of either a width or height. When I set more than that, like setting Output Width to 5000, then I got an error After Effects error: Motion Tiles cannot allocate a buffer larger than 30000 pixels in either dimension (516). In this case, we have to reduce either Output Width or Output Height.\nFurther improvements I haven't changed an appearance of a old film screen, but I found there are some articles or videos to explain about it. It looked not so simple so I skipped it, but it can make an animation better.\n","link":"https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/06/16/after-effects-practice-for-old-film-effects/","title":"After Effects: Practice for old film effects"},{"body":"This post is written using After Effects 2021.\nI made a simple video to use and compare effects described in this post.\nAudio spectrum/waveform effects In AE, there are two effects Audio Spectrum and Audio Waveform to visualize an audio file. I learned how to use an audio wavespectrum from next video.\nThese are steps for how to use it.\nImport an audio file to a project and also import it in the composition To show an audio wavespectrum, Add a Solid layer Add Audio Spectrum effect from Presets \u0026amp; Efforts \u0026gt; Generate into the solid layer Change Effects \u0026gt; Audio Spectrum \u0026gt; Audio Layer to the audio file Now, an audio spectrum was added into the composition.

The Audio Waveform is explained and used in the next video.\nMany values on Audio Spectrum and Audio Waveform affect their forms and animations, so it's important to change each value and see how it affects, like Display Options.\nNote that \u0026quot;Polar coordinates\u0026quot; is a mathematics term and we can see the details of it in Wikipedia.\n","link":"https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/06/15/after-effects-practice-for-visualizing-audio-file/","title":"After Effects: Practice for visualizing audio file"},{"body":"This post is written using After Effects 2021. I also added the links to videos where I learned how to do, so if you are unfamiliar with UIs on AEs, those videos are helpful for how to use.\nChat animation I made a chat animation, and from that knowledge, I made the next video.\nIn this post, I'll describe how I made this video, especially how to make a speech bubble in details.\nSpeech bubble There are a few things to consider to make a speech bubble.\nSpeech bubble shapes Make speech bubble reusable Add popup effect to a speech bubble A speech bubble shape I watched next video to learned how to make a speech bubble.\nFrom this video, I took these steps to make a speech bubble.\nTo make the shape Add a Shape Layer in the composition, let's say \u0026quot;Speech bubble shape\u0026quot; Add a Rounded Rectangle in the layer It doesn't have to be a rounded rectangle. You can add an ellipse, rectangle, or other shapes. Add a triangle in the shape layer using Pen Tool To hide strokes of the triangle on the basic rounded rectangle area, click Add on the right of Contents in the shape layer and choose Merge Path I couldn't add the triangle because it's hard to animate, change text, and change the size of the rectangle dynamically which I described in the later steps. Add a Text layer, let's say \u0026quot;Speech bubble text\u0026quot; Pre-compose the shape and text layers. Let's say \u0026quot;Speech bubble\u0026quot; for this pre-composition. Reusable speech bubble Next, in order to make multiple speech bubbles with different texts, we are going to make one precomposition and make it reusable using Essential Properties and Expression.\nWith Essential Properties, layers referring to the same precomposition can show different text With Expression, the shape layer can automatically resize even if the length of text changes Enable to change text without changing precomposition I learned how to use Essential Properties on next video.\nThese are steps to set text as essential properties of the pre-composition.\nOn Speech bubble precomposition, click \u0026quot;Open in Essential Graphics\u0026quot; by a right click on the precomposition or under \u0026quot;Edit\u0026quot; tab On the Essential Graphics window, check if \u0026quot;Primary\u0026quot; shows the name of precomposition, which is \u0026quot;Speech bubble\u0026quot; in this post. If not, change it so To add an essential property of the precomposition, drag Text \u0026gt; Source Text under the text layer into the \u0026quot;Essential Graphics\u0026quot; window Rename the property name of Source Text if you want. In this post, keep it as it is, which means \u0026quot;Source Text\u0026quot;. Open the original composition layer and see you can see Essential Properties under the precomposion \u0026quot;Speech bubble\u0026quot; on the timeline window. Now different text with same precomposition can be set even if we duplicate the layer using this Essential Properties. For example, \u0026quot;TEXT 1\u0026quot; can be set on a layer while \u0026quot;TEXT 2\u0026quot; can be set on another layer Note that text must be double-quoted.b in Essential Properties, and \\n has to be used for a line separator for a multi line text Auto resize the rectangle matching with the text size I learned how to resize a rectangle automatically whenever the text length changes from next video.\nThese are steps to do it:\nAdd Effects \u0026amp; Presets \u0026gt; Expression Controls \u0026gt; Slider Control effect into the \u0026quot;Speech bubble shape\u0026quot; layer\nRename Slider Control under Speech bubble shape \u0026gt; Effects to \u0026quot;Padding\u0026quot;, because this slider value is used for it between the text and the border of the rectangle\nTo edit Expression on the size of the rectangle, expand Speech bubble shape \u0026gt; Contents \u0026gt; Rectangle 1 \u0026gt; Rectangle Path 1 \u0026gt; Size and click \u0026quot;Size\u0026quot; while pressing alt key.\nUpdate the Expression to next in order to update the size of the rectangle automatically.\nd = thisComp.layer(\u0026#34;Speech bubble text\u0026#34;).sourceRectAtTime(); padding = effect(\u0026#34;Padding\u0026#34;)(\u0026#34;Slider\u0026#34;); x = d.width + padding; y = d.height + padding; [x, y] Besides the above steps, it's better to change \u0026quot;Anchor Point\u0026quot; with the same way in the case if there are multiple lines on the Text layer. Next video explains well about how to update expressions in each case.\nThese are steps for my video.\nFirst of all, set \u0026quot;Parent Layer\u0026quot; on the Text Layer.\nIf \u0026quot;Parent \u0026amp; Link\u0026quot; column doesn't show on the timeline window, at first you have to make it visible. To do it, right click on the header on the window and mark Columns \u0026gt; Parent \u0026amp; Link. Choose \u0026quot;Speech bubble shape\u0026quot; layer on the \u0026quot;Parent \u0026amp; Link\u0026quot; of \u0026quot;Speech bubble text\u0026quot; layer. Set next expressions on Speech bubble text \u0026gt; Transform \u0026gt; Anchor Point.\nd = thisLayer.sourceRectAtTime(); x = d.width / 2 + d.left; y = d.height / 2 + d.top; [x, y] Similary, set next expressions on Speech bubble shape \u0026gt; Transform \u0026gt; Anchor Point.\nd = thisComp.layer(\u0026#34;Speech bubble text\u0026#34;).sourceRectAtTime(); x = d.width / 2 + d.left; y = d.height / 2 + d.top; [x, y] Add popup effect on the speech bubble I learned popup effect which looks it can be used in a chat animation from next video.\nIt's simple to do, but I just did next.\nChange \u0026quot;Scales\u0026quot; of the \u0026quot;Speech bubble shape\u0026quot; layer on the timeline At first, set 0 on the timeline Then, Move to a value more than 100, like 110 At last goes back to 100 Because \u0026quot;Parent \u0026amp; Link\u0026quot; was added on the text layer, when the shape layer scales, the text layer also automatically scales as well.\nChat screen In the previous section, I made the Speech bubble precomposition. For chat animation, I created 2 more compositions for the video.\nChat screen composition: which includes layers to each speech bubble Set the timeline for when each speech bubble shows Set \u0026quot;Essential Properties\u0026quot; for what text it should show on each speech bubble This composition itself have a bigger height than main composition Main composition: Use chat screen composition Change Transform \u0026gt; Position of Chat screen composition to camera in and out on the screen. After making this, the video on the top of this page can be made.\nFurther improvements Add a triangle to a speech bubble Because I couldn't change the size and position automatically when a text is updated, I removed the triangle of a speech bubble. I think if I can use \u0026quot;Expression\u0026quot; better, it's possible to do, but I have no idea how to do.\n","link":"https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/06/14/practice-for-a-chat-animation-in-adobe-after-effects/","title":"Practice for a chat animation in Adobe After Effects"},{"body":"This is a note when I tried to make a rain scene.

The composition size of the animation is 1920 x 1080.\nFor small rain drops sticking with the window Radius X: 320 Radius Y: 320 Velocity: 0 Birth Rate: 80 Longevity: 20 Gravity: 0.0001 Blob Birth Size: 0.02 Blob Death Size: 0.02 For big rain drops falling down on the window shortly Radius X: 320 Radius Y: 320 Velocity: 0.01 Birth Rate: 0.5 Longevity: 100 Gravity: 0.01 Blob Birth Size: 0.15 Blob Death Size: 0.2 Added Displament Map effect I also watched next video to understand about Displament Map and Fracteral Noise, so it might be worth watching if you are not familiar with it.\nRaining For Raining animation, I watched next video and learned Cc Rainfall effect can be used.\nThese are steps to add this effect:\nAdd an Adjustment layer and add Simulation \u0026gt; Cc Rainfall effect to the layer To make raining better, update CC Rainfall values If rain is strong, then Change Drops to show bigger number of rains Change Size to show each rain makes it clear Change Speed If it's windy day, then to make rains fall diagonally, Change Wind and/or Spread value to bigger In my video, the values of these are:\nDrops: 1000 Size: 3.0 Speed: 4000 Wind: 0 Spread: 6 Fogged window I learned the idea of fogged window is from next video. In next video, there are many explanations not only fogged window, but also rain drops and how to make them more realistic.\nTo show a fogged window in AE, making our background blurred is one way. I used Camera Lens Blur for my animation, but there are other types of blue so with them you can highly likely do similar things.\nAdd Blur \u0026amp; Sharpen \u0026gt; Camera Lens Blur to the background layer Change Camera Lens Blur values Change Blur Radius to show how strong the window is fogged Text on a foggy window I couldn't find any information on how to show rain texts on a foggy window for AE, but there was a video for Photoshop and it can be used in AE too. Next video is the one to explain how to show rain text on a foggy window with Photoshop.\nIn AE, we can add rain texts similarily and quite easily by:\nAdd a text layer and write texts Change the mode from Normal to Overlay on the text layer Change the text color to black. The color depends on the blightness of background, but black usually works unless the background is dark Further improvements Melting text For the words on the window in a rainy day, it's not always clear and usually looked like \u0026quot;melting\u0026quot;, or being erased gradually. I couldn't find how to do very well and easily.\nMore realistic rain drops In this post, I described to animate rain drops using Mr Mercurity. But instead, there is a sophisticated way to show more reliastic rain drops explained in the next video.\nI didn't choose this way because it was too complicated and Mr Mercury was simple and sufficient for me, but if you do not satify with it, the way explained in this video may be helpful.\n","link":"https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/06/09/after-effects-practice-for-raining-animation/","title":"After Effects: Practice for raining animation"},{"body":"This is the note for my practice to an illustration as a beginner.\nToday's illustration The next left illustration is the one before I practiced and right one is after I did to draw Anemachi, who is a sister of VTuber Suisei Hoshimachi.\nBefore After In this time, I practiced how to draw a sidetail hair. I couldn't find very good books or videos for drawing it unfortunatelly, so I just reviewed my illustration, considered how to improve, and practiced.\nThese are steps I practiced:\nReviewed my original illustration by myself Picked up a few things for improvements Practiced and figured out a few things I thought I can improve Redrew my illustration and checked what was improved Reviewed my original illustration What can be better Shade and shadows of sidetail hairs can be better Neck might be too long Wider left shoulder might be better. Lower eyebrows might be better Her eye ring can be more bright Sidetail hairs can be less sharp and softer The shapes of star hair pins are too sharp Hair highlight can be more bright Body part between breast and arm can be drawn more natural Collars can show less flat The place to tie for a sidetail hair can be draw better The angle of body and face can be more natural? What was drawn well It looks not very strange overall to me, though there are tons of things that can be improved Practice and lessons I decided to practice how to draw a sidetail hair.\nI couldn't find good books nor videos to draw a sidetail hair better, and also noticed it's the challenge for me to draw it because it's not tied by a simple way, and I didn't understand how to draw it of hers.\nSo, first of all, I checked illustrations of other people, listed on here, and see how they drew And noticed it seemed it's the bun hair with a sidetail, but I didn't draw the bun at all, so practiced drawing it.\nBesides that, I practiced and checked whether it's gonna improve something. These illustrations are those when I practiced:\nAs you might noticed, I modified step by step and see it was good or not. Then overall modifications made it better, so I decided to redraw my original illustration.\nWhat I redrew and what was improved After practice, I redrew it, which I showed on the top of this post.\nAfter redrawing, I thought the reason why the sidetail hair wasn't look good were:\nThere are a large area in this illustration, but it was too simple compared to others Towards edges of it, the shape looked too sharp and not unnatural flow from the root of it. Wrap up I uploaded these illustrations on my SNS accounts.\nPixiv DeviantArt One tip: this is the 1st time for me to use a layer mask, which can be used to hide a part of a layer. The clip studio paint account on a twitter said and explained about it on this link. I often delete the lines on the line layers to clean up but I wanted to save those line information in order to recover it, and a layer mask can be used for this purpose. But it requires modifying layer mask as well all the time, so I'll see how much it's useful and worth using it.\n","link":"https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/05/11/practice-to-the-sidetail-hair-of-anemachi/","title":"Practice to the sidetail hair of Anemachi"},{"body":"This is the note for my practice to an illustration as a beginner.\nToday's illustration The next left illustration is the one before I practiced and right onw is after I did.\nBefore After In this time, I practiced and learned these things\nColors for shades and shadows of hairs Even if the color of shade and shadow is different from the basic hair color, it doesn't screw up the illustration. The different color gives a different impression as well as another information of a character. Colors depend on each character, and it's OK to use the different color for shade and shadows even though different characters have the identical hair color. Colors for lights This also affects how you wanna show your illustration, especially what the surrounding area of the character is. Besides the above points, I modified a little bit about shade and shadow colors to make them weaker. To practice, I tried these steps to improve this original illustration:\nReviewed my illustration by myself Picked up a few things for improvements Practiced and figured out a few things I though I can improve Redrew my illustration and checked what was improved Before coloring shades and shadows The illustration I practiced today is the one I drew on this article. And before drawing shades and shadows, I modified several things to improve it:\nOriginal Modified What I modified was\nChanged color layer below to line layer, which I learned on this article. Edited the eyes' positions lower, and also changed their angles little bit Edited the head smaller Edited the sidetail hair and hair ribbon closer to the ear Added details on the cloth Added a frame line Changed a skin color from too yello to red-ish After these changes, I added shades, shadows, and high lights on the illustration.\nBefore coloring details After coloring details Review my illustration I reviewed my illustration after I painted shades and shadows.\nWhat can be better Face can still be more natural, further Lights can be more emphasized using highlights on many places other than hairs. The star on her tie can look less flat Cheek can be drawn more natural Hair can be made less flat, especially the front part of her hair Her plaid jacket can look less flat, probably because no shade nor shadow Her hair ribbon can look more solid, especially lower part of ribbons should look the far side more than the above one It's not weird, but it might be more modern that the color of shadows are closer to the original skin? What was drawn well Overall colors of shadows and how they looked. I intentionally chose strong colors for shadows Hair highlights. This was one of the most difficult thing for me to draw well on this illustration Where I should add shadows Practice and lessons At first, I watched a few videos for shades, shadows, and lights. I had checked some of them, but revisited again in order to get ideas better and refreshed my memory. Unfortunatelly, all fo them is Japanese audio.\nYouTube: Naoki Saito illust Channel - How to draw attractive hairs of characters for digital illustrations (Japanese) YouTube: Deep Blizzard's Art School - How not to fail choosing skin colors of characters for digital illustrations (Japanese) YouTube: Deep Blizzard's Art School - How to Shade Hair [Super Introductory Course #40] Deep Blizzard (Japanese) After watching these videos, next things are especially something I remembered well:\nThe shade and shadow colors of hairs can change impressions of characters. In other words, we do not have to stick with which color is right or not. It's one way to change impressions of a character. More details of shades, shadows or lights are added, more relistic an illustration is. But anime character illustration is a way to deform a person, so sometimes, more realistic doesn't always mean it's good. If the highlight of hairs is jagged, then it shows the pieces of hairs are lighten up But I feel if we try to draw jagged too much, it's gonna be more realistic drawing rather than deformed one. So, from these learnings, I felt next things are important and decided to try practicing these things mainly for this illustration:\nHair's shadow colors How to draw lights Hair's shade and shadow colors Following what Naoki said on this video, I did the same things to change multiple colors for how different color of shades and shadows changes impressions, and decide which one looks the best. But when I tried doing it, I noticed I cannot color to what I wanted, because I usually use a \u0026quot;multiply\u0026quot; layer for shade and shadow, and it is affected by the color of its base color layer.\nSo, I tried a multiply layer to add a few colors which I wanna show, and also use a normal layer to color the shade and shadow for what I wanted to try. These are the things I tried.\nUsing a multiply layer. I wanted to color shade and shadows to red and yellow in a few of them, but it shows purples and green, respectively. Using a normal layer. From these practices, what I felt was\nWhen shade and shadow is colored by different colors like red, yellow, or green, it adds new information or impression the character.\nOn the other hand, because the base hair color is blue, when shade and shadows are colored by one close to the base color, it doesn't change any impression. Using multiply layers can add shade and shadow with different colors, but sometimes it leads to unexpected colors. It looks more natural and fits to an illustration easily, but it might not be something you wanted.\nUsing normal layers with different colors, it can add different colors easily, but it's challenging to use completely different colors. It might be good in a few cases, like characters in a fantasy story, but may not be good in some cases.\nI actually like to add red shades on the above practice, because I felt it added an impression for passionate and warmth, so I decided to use it, though her character color is blue.\nAttempts to learn how to draw lights I couldn't find very good videos or articles to talk about where we should put lights on faces or clothese concretely, so I tried a few ways to add lights and see what and how it changes.\nPractice: I only tried 5 patterns where I should put lights. I couldn't come up with other ways to drastically change the lights except changing light colors. But I guess changing light colors is almost similar effect which I learned from shades and shadows, so I skipped it. Also, as you can see, I removed a black outer line from \u0026quot;Lights on outer parts\u0026quot; illustration because it reduced effects of lights.\nFrom this practice, things I thought:\nAdding lights can be used to get paid attentions to the places where are lighten part Because it is strongly get paid attentions, if lights are not important, it's better to draw them only a small amount When lights are drawn on a specific side, it strongly emphasizes the existence of lights and i felt the light in such an illustration is very important factor. The lights on the border of a character are a little bit different impressions from other lights. I can be wrong but it's more like emphasizing a character her/himself, like a character is lively. Though I also felt it implies the environment or situation is filled with a full of lights What I redrew and what was improved So from these learnings, I redrew my original illustration, as I showed it on the beginning of this page.\nBesides changing the color of shade and shadow of hair and highlights, I edited the color for other shades and shadows too, in order to make them weaker. It might not be necessary, but I felt it implied how dark her surrounding environment was.\nFrom what I learned, I think it changed my illustration well. These things completely depend on how I wanted to show on the illustration, and not something like there is a correct answer, but it makes the illustration be what I wanted to imagine a little bit, to show that she is in a lighten place and also she is lively.\nAttempt to add a background I didn't plan to add any background, but all of a sudden, I wanted to have a background to make this illustration better, so tried to add simple background.\nI hope this background can show that she is lighten up by a moon, and doesn't mismatch with the shades, shadows, and lights I added.\nWrap up Here is the links to today's illustration on my SNS accounts.\nPixiv DeviantArt Also, for future improvements, I felt it's probably better to try drawing anime characters by deforming from real people, so that we can understand how to draw lines, colors, shades, shadows, and lights. I didn't do it, but will try it and see how useful it is some day.\n","link":"https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/05/08/practice-to-color-shades-and-shadows-of-hairs-and-lights-of-a-character/","title":"Practice to color shades and shadows of hairs and lights of a character"},{"body":"This is the note for my practice to an illustration by a beginner.\nToday's illustration The above illustration is the one before I practiced and below one is after I practiced.

These are summaries for my learnings:\nIn many articles or many people said, womens should be drawn more rounded and not sharp or square shapes. Consider affected areas while drawing lines especially it's not from front view. In this case, I should have cared how the cheek and jaw look when I drew a mouth and eyes Eyes are not wide enough to touch with a side hair from a profile view. I should have drawn smaller. Here is the links to today's illustration on my SNS accounts.\nLink to Pixiv I tried these steps to improve this original illustration:\nSelf review my illustration Pick up a few things for improvements Practice and figure out a few things I can improve Redraw my illustration and check what was improved Review my illustration What can be better The head or face can be softer and look her more like a woman Breast can look more 3D and also can recognize its shape Skirt should be affected by gravity, so should belt chains Directions of hands or nails can be more natural towards the far side Hairs can have more details Hair pin can look more natural from this angle It's obvious that boots are duplicated, so make them less obvious What was drawn well The pleat on the skirt looks good, and also its wrinkle does, too One of boots is drawn well Shape of legs is not so weird What I practiced On this time, I chose to practice improving the head and face of the illustration. From this head, I felt a creepy impression from this illustration, especially because she is not a female. At first, I need to figure out why it does.\nI just hide color layers and frame line layer, but it didn't change the impression so much, so it turned out it's from line layers.\nSo, I copied original illustration and changed a little bit on each head or body part, and see how's gonna be changed. Following illustrations are things I changed and saw how it changes.\nPractice 1 Practice 2 Practice 3 (Improve an original illustration one by one) What I found I still feels it's not completely natural for a woman's character, but it's hard for me to figure out why it isn't. I need to have an ability to recognize what gives how I feel, but things I found this time are:\nIn many articles or many people said, womens should be drawn more rounded and not sharp or square shapes. Consider affected areas while drawing lines especially it's not from front view. In this case, I should have cared how the cheek and jaw look when I drew a mouth and eyes Eyes are not wide enough to touch with a side hair from a profile view. I should have drawn smaller. What I redrew and what was improved So, I redrew the illustration with these changes. And this is the one I redrew after the practice.\nAnd I completely remove the line of the side of the jaw and instead color the shade of the neck, because the line still gave me an impression as a male character. Instead of showing the line, I change the layer of it to the draft layer, so that it won't show up after I export it to an image, if I'm not mistaken. But this change may not be necessary, because when you can see anime, the line for a jaw is clearly drawn for a profile.\n","link":"https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/04/09/practice-drawing-a-head-and-face-from-a-profile-view/","title":"Practice drawing a head and face from a profile view"},{"body":"This is the 3rd note for an illustration by a beginner.\nToday's illustration Next left illustration is the one before I learned and right one is after I learned. I haven't finished coloring shades and shadows because I would update the original illustration after this practice. This time, it's gonna be easier to see the difference of 2 illustrations when you turn off a dark mode.\nBefore After In this time, I learned how to color an illustration. These are summaries for what I changed on Clip Studio Paint.\nChange a layer structure Before: Line layer is below a color layer After: Line layer is above a color layer Create new layer for a character silhouette to clip from other layers Enable some options to color more cleanly on Fill tool Fill narrow areas Fill up to vector path Here is the links to today's illustration on my SNS accounts.\nLink to Pixiv I tried these steps to improve this original illustration:\nSelf review my illustration Pick up a few things I need to focus on improving Learned how to do Draw my illustration by new way 1. Review my illustration What can be better An upper body can be more straight. Right now, it's a little bit leaning to the left Head might be bigger or shape might be wider Stripes, especially gray lines, of arms can be bigger so it's gonna be impressive and noticeable Outer frame line of a chracter can be sharpen and can remove a tons of circles The shape of shoes can make it better. Actually I didn't see a real shoes while I was drawing Knee can be wider so that we can avoid making an impression that she has big muscles in her thigh or calf The shape of the crown can be better wider to the top from the bottom. Currently, it's almost flat Sleeves of her arms can be shorter and can be drawn and make different impressions There are transparent spaces surrounding lines due to anti-aliasing Skin colors can be changed to more pink from yellow The ribbon of her sidetail hair can be more rounded so that it can make a feeling an shape of the hair. It's too straight right now Each pleats on the skirt can be separated more. Now it looks flat a lot The dark blue part of her skirt can be more lighter. Maybe white lines or yellow lines can be bigger and more noticeable. The central line of deep gray stripe lines can be wider It might be too flat color. It might be relieved by increasing the number of colors? What was drawn well It took time but drew her full body Stripes of her costume. This requires a lot of works, but drew well with drawing lines over and over instead of using Fill tool Draw the hairlines of the back of her head but it looks natural A gradiation of the ribbon on her back Frill of a skirt Vertical ratios of bodies, from head to shoes 2. What I learned This time, I picked up There are transparent spaces surrounding lines due to anti-aliasing from what can be better and learned how to color on Clip Studio Paint.\nI hadn't learned it so much, and sometimes couldn't fill some empty areas very well even though I tried to use \u0026quot;Paint unfilled area\u0026quot; on Fill tool and didn't work as expected. I thought it was because I enabled an anti-aliasing option of the vector layer, but also I was sure there was a way to solve it. So, I spent time to learn and solve it on this time.\nAt first, I watched these videos for coloring:\nYouTube: Baban Illustration - QUICK FLATS AND COLORING IN CLIP STUDIO PAINT AND MANGA STUDIO - HOW TO USE SELECTION AND FILL TOOL (Japanese) YouTube: Deep Blizzard's Art School - ④はじめてのクリスタ／レイヤー・色塗り1【超入門講座#26】 #ディープブリザード​ #clipstudio​ From the videos, I noticed I colored my illustration differently.\nThe order of line and color layers is different I also didn't use some options due to this difference I didn't prepare one color layer of a character to clip from other layers One layer to be painted by single color It's something like silhouette layer. I do not know how to call this layer Structure of layers It seems layers of some illustrators are ordered by\nSpecial effects like highlights Line Color But I drew my illustration by following orders\n(Lines over colors) Colors Line So I followed other illustrastrators structure and tried to color my illustration by this structure.\nCreate a layer to draw a color with a character Next, I actually didn't prepare one layer for a clip from other layers, like next image:\nBut it seems some illustrators do this before start coloring details not to draw outside of a character. So I decided to follow this and learned how to do, especially it could reduce my mistakes.\nIn order to fill a character from line layers, we can do it relatively easily by using Auto select and Invert selected area on Select menu.\nChoose Auto select tool and select the area except a character Select Select \u0026gt; Invert selected area After select a layer to fill by a single color, click Fill icon on the command bar, which is under the menu bar This should work. You may fill an area which you do not want to, in that case, undo and choose the areas when you select on Auto select tool.\nEnable useful options for coloring These are options I missed or I couldn't turn on\nWhen you choose Refer other layers on the Fill tool, enable Fill narrow area under Close gap. You may need to show it from Show [Sub Tool Detail palette]... menu. Enable Fill up to vector path option I didn't use this because I originally show color layers above the line, not below the line layers. And this option made my illustration worse. Just coloring an illustration From the above things, I colored my illustrations without changing line layers. Next images are those of before and after I applied what I described on this page.\nAs you can see, it improved a lot because there is no empty space surrounding some lines like the lines of her back ribbon. Because we do not change anything on line layers, there are some lines that should be hidden by the back of the ribbon or the crown. I also prepared outer frame line from the silhouette layer with \u0026quot;Border effect\u0026quot; of such a layer.\nBefore After Then after I cleaned up some line layers, then I made the illustration posted on the top of this page.\nTried to mix line colors with the colors from surrounding areas I also compared when I tried to change line colors to mix the colors from surrounding areas, by creating new layer from color layers and apply a Gaussian blur, but my original approach didn't improve it at all because I clipped the layer from the line layers and empty spaces I failed to draw didn't get changed.\nWrap it up So, even if I turn on anti aliasing on vector modes, I can improve coloring significantly I didn't doubt my layer structure isn't so much different from others for some reasons, so it's always better to check what other illustrators said if something doesn't work, tried it, and compare what the result would be.\n","link":"https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/04/05/practice-learn-how-to-color-an-illustration-on-clip-studio-paint/","title":"Practice: Learn how to color an illustration on Clip Studio Paint"},{"body":"This is the 2nd drawing practice note by a beginner for an illustration.\nToday's illustration Left one of next illustrations is one before I practiced and right side is one after I practiced. I haven't finished painting colors, like adding shades or shadows, to them in order to check and practice what can be significantly better in terms of lines drawings at first.\nBefore After It might be hard to notice what was changed, but I practiced hands and fingers because it looked weird on the left illustration.\nThese are summaries for today's practice\nHands are complex so that we should draw roughs by multiple steps, and not by a single step. In some cases, it's better to draw after most of other parts is complete, especially when hands do not affect other parts There are many small things that could change an impression of fingers. Here is the links to today's illustration on my SNS accounts.\nLink to Pixiv I tried these steps to improve this original illustration, which was the same way as last time.\nFigure out what can be better Pick up a few things I need to focus on improving Practice and figure out a few things I have to do Redraw the illustration and check what was improve 1. What can be better I checked my original illustration and listed up what can be better. These are what I thought:\nFingers of a right hand were supposed to be bent and also be thinner Drawing nails, like shapes or the sizes, can be improved especially when fingers are bent Skin colors can be more natural than current colors Chains of her belt can be bigger so viewers can recognize them The position of her right elbow is supposed to be higher Details can be added around her right breast The lines surrounding her breast can be to imply the size of her bust by being drawn by shorter widths The stregnth of a darker pen and lighter pen with same size isn't so different I used a darker pen for the frame lines of most of body, cloths, or accessories, and use a lighter pen inside lines of each body part, cloth, or accessory. LIghter pen with the same width should be used for a real or clear line, but shouldn't be used for weak lines like a wrinkle. For it, it's better to make the width smaller. The position of her left shoulder is better to be lower Gravity should be considered more. I considered it when I drew her hairs or ear rings, but it was not sufficient and also it can't be seen for a skirt. 2. What I practiced I practiced hands, especially fingers, and those when fingers are bent\nVideos that I checked in order to learn how to draw hands:\nYouTube: Love2DrawManga - Tips for Drawing Hands! (Japanese) YouTube: Naoki Saito Illust Channel - Tips to draw charming hands anyone can do easily /【誰でも簡単】手を魅力的に描くコツ Also, I practiced drawing hands by a croquis by watching next video.\nYouTube: Enahkre - 23 One Minute Hand References But I noticed it was especially hard to draw fingers being bent to the far side, and not bent to the left or right sides. So, I practiced hands that fingers were bent but the point of view isn't diagonal, because I thought it was the best practice for this illustration.\n3. What I found As I wrote, at first, I tried a croquis, and next illustration is an example of what I drew. It's really good to practice hands by a croquis, especially a lot of forms, but not good to find new things and how I can improve.\nThen, next illustration was the one I tried to draw and tried to find what I could improve, though each of them was small thing.\nBesides, during this practice, I noticed it's better to draw hands by multiple roughs, to make it better gradually. I had drew the hand in the original illustration very rough at first, and jumped to draw complete hand, but a hand is complex and drawing hands should be taken care more like other human parts. I think if the hands are not the main part of an illustration, it's probably better to draw roughs of hands after roughs for most of other body parts ended because it's doesn't affect other body parts so much but may get affected by other body parts a lot.\nOther learnings Custome brush This was the 1st time to use a custom brush. I used it for the chain on her skirt. In order to use it, I just downloaded \u0026quot;Necklace brush\u0026quot; made by Fukomu (ふうこむ) and used it.\nThere is an official help page for how to use downloaded brushes, so check it out for more details.\nWhat I redrew and what was improved As I posted on the top of this page, this is the illustration after I modified her hands.\nI think these are improved points:\nThe shapes of nails became more natural Each part of hands can now be distinguished clearer. It can be done more by drawing lines clearer around knuckles. Fingers became thinner and more natural Fingers on the left hands become more natural because skins under nails can be seen on this angle Fingers might be too straight after modifying it Wrap it up First thing first, hands and fingers are small parts compared to other body parts. It's better to draw them by multiple roughs and draw them gradually to make them natural. The shapes or angles of hands can be changed variously on each situation, so it's really hard to find the common techniques to draw them in any situation other than those introduced in the learning materials shared on this page. So, I'll need practices in each case.\n","link":"https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/03/26/practice-illustrations/","title":"Practice illustrations"},{"body":"This is a note when I, a very beginnner of an illustration, practiced drawing an illustration. I left them here so I can refer to this in the future.\nToday's illustration These illustrations are those I drew very seriously, but left one is before practice and right one is after practice.\nBefore After Here is the links to today's illustration on my SNS accounts.\nLink to Pixiv I tried these steps to improve this original illustration.\nFigure out what can be better Pick up a few things I need to focus on improving Practice and figure out a few things I have to do Redraw the illustration and check what was improve These steps are from some steps as Naoki-sensei introduced in his video to get drawing better as early as possible in 3 months (no English).\n1. What can be better I listed up what I felt these can be improved.\nFace and hair Smiling face should be more natural, less weird, maybe around eyes or mouth is a cause. The line of eyes makes a weird impression and looks like fox. The line of the face isn't very natural, perhaps the face may be bigger or the jaw can be rounder. The amount of her hair may be more The angle of her side tail hair can be improved and can be more natural. Body Her breast from the side view isn't well drawn. The angle of the necklace (choker?) looks weird and not right. The shirt collar looks weird shape. It can be drawn better between her arms and body. 2. What I practiced Even though there are many things I was able to, I focused on these 2 things\nFacial expressions, including a smiling face Heads, especially faces,, from multiple angles I also noticed I didn't draw ATARI and it was helpful to draw a head from a diagonal angle. ATARI is simple circles, rectangles, or lines to show the rough position or the size. I don't know how to say correctly in English, so I'll say it a wire in this page. During practice, I read or checked these as learning materials:\nBook: Introduction to master faces, hair styles, and expressions in Manga from any angle (360°どんな角度もカンペキマスター!マンガキャラ顔・髪型・表情入門) Checked the pages to draw the head from each angle YouTube: Naoki Saito Illust Channel: Lecture to draw each expression easily (【簡単】表情の描き分け講座) No English subtitle You can see how eyebrows, eyes, or a mouth affect each expression And following illustrations are examples of what I drew.\nFacial expressions Change an angle of each face part Change a position of each face part Heads from multiple angles Drew without a wire Drew with a wire 3. What I found Facial expressions I changed each part of a face and checked how it affects, but because there are so many patterns and not very particular common things, I couldn't find a lot.\nThe things I found was followings, though I saw these in the above video:\nDistance between eyes and jaw: Shorter it is, more childish And from the above video, eyebrows show what expression is mostly, and mouth shows how strong the expression is. Anyway, I felt that the weirdness of my original illustration was from the face of the angle and not from the smile face.\nHeads from many angles I found these things:\nAngles affect each distance and shape If the angle is from the above, the distance between a nose and a mouth is short. It's opposite if the angle is from the bottom. The eye is not on the straight line, but it's on the curved line. If the camera position is closer, then the head gets big and wide. It's opposite if the part of the head is far away. If the angle is from the bottom, then the bottom part of a jaw can also be seen and we have to be conscious For the side profile, the size of eyes gets smaller than other angles For the side profile, the size of head is not complete circle. It's bigger than circle Eyeline is important. But overall, how to see a head and face is case by case on each angle, so it's better to see a model and check how it looks during drawing an illustration always.\nOther learning Draw frame lines with equal margins It's a side topic, but it was helpful when I drew many illustrations and changed each a little bit from others. On Clip Studio Paint, it's easily be prepared by:\nSelect Frame borders \u0026gt; Recntagle frame and draw it Right click the Frame layer and select Ruler/Frame \u0026gt; Divide frame border equally You can choose options for the number of vertical and horizontal divisions and also divide folders What I redraw and what was improved So, again, this is the same image on the top of this page.\nWhat I changed was\nEye angles: Before updating, eyes were drawn as if it's on the straight line, but after practice, eyes were like on the curved line. Eye and mouth positions: They were low compared to positions of ears and jaw, so I lifted them up. I think it reduced the weirdness of smiles from the original illustration.\nWrap it up This is the first time to write a post for an illustration and actually, I didn't think I was going to do while I was practicing, so maybe some illustrations or some explanations are not explained enough to be understood. Anyway, I felt it didn't improve a lot as I wanted, but at least changed the impression a little bit and reduce the weirdness. I guess face is one of the most important part in our body and made a big impact by changing it.\nAnyway, I'll keep doing this and hope it's gonna change my drawing skills.\n","link":"https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/03/21/illustration-practice/","title":"Practice illustrations"},{"body":"General Color Skin color pallete\nAnime CGing Tutorial: Color Choice Skin color palette Color palette for skin, hair, and eyes Real Skin Tones Color Scheme Skin colors European Example 1 from Anime CGing Tutorial.\nbase: #ecc4b8 shadow: #c78d7d highlight: #f8e9e6 2D animation Adobe After Effects is mainly described in this page.\nHow to show that a camera moves on one image Scale in/out the image Change the position of the image How to organize assets Use pre-compose.
