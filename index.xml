I posted next video on YouTube.
I used Adobe After Effects for 2D animation for the 1st time, so in this post, I described how I made each scene. I already wrote some posts to make this video for practice, so I just referred those posts on some scenes. But this is the first time to use AE, so there can be better ways to do.</description></item><item><title>After Effects: Practice for old film effects</title><link>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/06/16/after-effects-practice-for-old-film-effects/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jun 2021 03:01:07 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/06/16/after-effects-practice-for-old-film-effects/</guid><description>This post is written using After Effects 2021.
I wanted to show an animation like old tape films, and made the next video. In this video, I noted how I did it.
In fact, I noticed there are some plugins like motionarray, but I hadn't known before I made it. So, we might be able to do the same thing by easier way with them.
Besides, there is an article for describe how to repeat objects in AE.</description></item><item><title>After Effects: Practice for visualizing audio file</title><link>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/06/15/after-effects-practice-for-visualizing-audio-file/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2021 12:33:23 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/06/15/after-effects-practice-for-visualizing-audio-file/</guid><description>This post is written using After Effects 2021.
I made a simple video to use and compare effects described in this post.
Audio spectrum/waveform effects In AE, there are two effects Audio Spectrum and Audio Waveform to visualize an audio file. I learned how to use an audio wavespectrum from next video.
These are steps for how to use it.
Import an audio file to a project and also import it in the composition To show an audio wavespectrum, Add a Solid layer Add Audio Spectrum effect from Presets &amp;amp; Efforts &amp;gt; Generate into the solid layer Change Effects &amp;gt; Audio Spectrum &amp;gt; Audio Layer to the audio file Now, an audio spectrum was added into the composition.</description></item><item><title>Practice for a chat animation in Adobe After Effects</title><link>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/06/14/practice-for-a-chat-animation-in-adobe-after-effects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jun 2021 07:51:48 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/06/14/practice-for-a-chat-animation-in-adobe-after-effects/</guid><description>This post is written using After Effects 2021.

In this post, I'll describe how I made this video, especially how to make a speech bubble in details.</description></item><item><title>After Effects: Practice for raining animation</title><link>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/06/09/after-effects-practice-for-raining-animation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2021 01:32:21 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/06/09/after-effects-practice-for-raining-animation/</guid><description>This is a note when I tried to make a rain scene.
