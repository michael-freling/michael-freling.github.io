Step 1: Scale an entire text on Geometry Nodes Add a Instances &amp;gt; Scale Instances node and connect between Group Input and Group Output Set Y of Scale to 2.0 and make sure the text scales Add a Utilities &amp;gt; Text &amp;gt; String to Curves node and set the String field on the node Connect from Curve Instances of String to Curves to Instances of Scale Instances instead of Group Input.</description></item><item><title>Blender: Animate a gradient material</title><link>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2023/12/16/blender-animate-a-gradient-material/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Dec 2023 15:17:29 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2023/12/16/blender-animate-a-gradient-material/</guid><description>This post was written using Blender 4.0.
This blog is about to create the animation for color gradient. The final output of this post is like next:
Step 1. Add a color gradient To add color gradient to a material, go to the Sharding tab and update nodes like the next.
This is basically by:
Add a Texture &amp;gt; Gradient Texture node Add a Converter &amp;gt; Color Ramp node between Gradient Texture and Principled BSDF Step 2.</description></item><item><title>CI for Next.js with GraphQL by Cypress and GitHub Actions</title><link>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2022/09/03/ci-for-next.js-with-graphql-by-cypress-and-github-actions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Sep 2022 14:29:20 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2022/09/03/ci-for-next.js-with-graphql-by-cypress-and-github-actions/</guid><description>CI is used to run automated testings before merging a change into the main branch.

Final For editing I uploaded the final painting on my SNS accounts.
Pixiv DeviantArt Challenges In this painting, I needed to figure out what is a good way to draw her with the reflection of lights from monitors in the dark room.</description></item><item><title>Indie Animation: Change 1st Episode</title><link>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2022/03/05/indie-animation-change-1st-episode/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2022 10:51:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2022/03/05/indie-animation-change-1st-episode/</guid><description>This is the summary about the next video.

I posted next video on YouTube.
I used Adobe After Effects for 2D animation for the 1st time, so in this post, I described how I made each scene. I already wrote some posts to make this video for practice, so I just referred those posts on some scenes. But this is the first time to use AE, so there can be better ways to do.</description></item><item><title>After Effects: Practice for old film effects</title><link>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/06/16/after-effects-practice-for-old-film-effects/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jun 2021 03:01:07 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/06/16/after-effects-practice-for-old-film-effects/</guid><description>This post is written using After Effects 2021.
I wanted to show an animation like old tape films, and made the next video. In this video, I noted how I did it.
In fact, I noticed there are some plugins like motionarray, but I hadn't known before I made it. So, we might be able to do the same thing by easier way with them.
Besides, there is an article for describe how to repeat objects in AE.</description></item><item><title>After Effects: Practice for visualizing audio file</title><link>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/06/15/after-effects-practice-for-visualizing-audio-file/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2021 12:33:23 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/06/15/after-effects-practice-for-visualizing-audio-file/</guid><description>This post is written using After Effects 2021.
I made a simple video to use and compare effects described in this post.
Audio spectrum/waveform effects In AE, there are two effects Audio Spectrum and Audio Waveform to visualize an audio file. I learned how to use an audio wavespectrum from next video.
These are steps for how to use it.
Import an audio file to a project and also import it in the composition To show an audio wavespectrum, Add a Solid layer Add Audio Spectrum effect from Presets &amp;amp; Efforts &amp;gt; Generate into the solid layer Change Effects &amp;gt; Audio Spectrum &amp;gt; Audio Layer to the audio file Now, an audio spectrum was added into the composition.</description></item><item><title>Practice for a chat animation in Adobe After Effects</title><link>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/06/14/practice-for-a-chat-animation-in-adobe-after-effects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jun 2021 07:51:48 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/06/14/practice-for-a-chat-animation-in-adobe-after-effects/</guid><description>This post is written using After Effects 2021. I also added the links to videos where I learned how to do, so if you are unfamiliar with UIs on AEs, those videos are helpful for how to use.
Chat animation I made a chat animation, and from that knowledge, I made the next video.
In this post, I'll describe how I made this video, especially how to make a speech bubble in details.</description></item><item><title>After Effects: Practice for raining animation</title><link>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/06/09/after-effects-practice-for-raining-animation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2021 01:32:21 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/06/09/after-effects-practice-for-raining-animation/</guid><description>This is a note when I tried to make a rain scene. I'm not very familiar with Adobe After Effects, so some steps can be inefficient or incorrect, so please keep in mind about there might be better way when you read this post.
The example of the animation I made on this post is next one.
The background of this animation is from this page.
There are a few effects to make the rain scene more realistic:</description></item><item><title>Practice to the sidetail hair of Anemachi</title><link>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/05/11/practice-to-the-sidetail-hair-of-anemachi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 May 2021 14:13:16 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/05/11/practice-to-the-sidetail-hair-of-anemachi/</guid><description>This is the note for my practice to an illustration as a beginner.
Today's illustration The next left illustration is the one before I practiced and right one is after I did to draw Anemachi, who is a sister of VTuber Suisei Hoshimachi.
Before After In this time, I practiced how to draw a sidetail hair. I couldn't find very good books or videos for drawing it unfortunatelly, so I just reviewed my illustration, considered how to improve, and practiced.</description></item><item><title>Practice to color shades and shadows of hairs and lights of a character</title><link>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/05/08/practice-to-color-shades-and-shadows-of-hairs-and-lights-of-a-character/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 May 2021 01:24:10 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/05/08/practice-to-color-shades-and-shadows-of-hairs-and-lights-of-a-character/</guid><description>This is the note for my practice to an illustration as a beginner.

Colors for shades and shadows of hairs Even if the color of shade and shadow is different from the basic hair color, it doesn't screw up the illustration.</description></item><item><title>Practice drawing a head and face from a profile view</title><link>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/04/09/practice-drawing-a-head-and-face-from-a-profile-view/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 13:34:51 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/04/09/practice-drawing-a-head-and-face-from-a-profile-view/</guid><description>This is the note for my practice to an illustration by a beginner.
Today's illustration The above illustration is the one before I practiced and below one is after I practiced. I haven't finished coloring most of shades and shadows because I would update the original illustration after this practice.

Today's illustration Left one of next illustrations is one before I practiced and right side is one after I practiced. I haven't finished painting colors, like adding shades or shadows, to them in order to check and practice what can be significantly better in terms of lines drawings at first.
Before After It might be hard to notice what was changed, but I practiced hands and fingers because it looked weird on the left illustration.</description></item><item><title>Practice illustrations</title><link>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/03/21/illustration-practice/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Mar 2021 08:41:32 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://michael-freling.github.io/posts/2021/03/21/illustration-practice/</guid><description>This is a note when I, a very beginnner of an illustration, practiced drawing an illustration.
