This is the note for my practice to an illustration as a beginner.

Today's illustration

The next left illustration is the one before I practiced and right one is after I did to draw Anemachi, who is a sister of VTuber Suisei Hoshimachi.

In this time, I practiced how to draw a sidetail hair.
I couldn't find very good books or videos for drawing it unfortunatelly, so I just reviewed my illustration, considered how to improve, and practiced.

These are steps I practiced:

1. Reviewed my original illustration by myself
1. Picked up a few things for improvements
1. Practiced and figured out a few things I thought I can improve
1. Redrew my illustration and checked what was improved


Reviewed my original illustration

### What can be better

1. Shade and shadows of sidetail hairs can be better
1. Neck might be too long
1. Wider left shoulder might be better.
1. Lower eyebrows might be better
1. Her eye ring can be more bright
1. Sidetail hairs can be less sharp and softer
1. The shapes of star hair pins are too sharp
1. Hair highlight can be more bright
1. Body part between breast and arm can be drawn more natural
1. Collars can show less flat
1. The place to tie for a sidetail hair can be draw better
1. The angle of body and face can be more natural?

### What was drawn well

1. It looks not very strange overall to me, though there are tons of things that can be improved

Practice and lessons

I decided to practice how to draw a sidetail hair.

I couldn't find good books nor videos to draw a sidetail hair better, and also noticed it's the challenge for me to draw it because it's not tied by a simple way, and I didn't understand how to draw it of hers.

So, first of all, I checked illustrations of other people, listed on [here](https://pin.it/PXRgKJf), and see how they drew
And noticed it seemed it's the bun hair with a sidetail, but I didn't draw the bun at all, so practiced drawing it.

Besides that, I practiced and checked whether it's gonna improve something. These illustrations are those when I practiced:

As you might noticed, I modified step by step and see it was good or not.
Then overall modifications made it better, so I decided to redraw my original illustration.

What I redrew and what was improved
---

After practice, I redrew it, which I showed on the top of this post.

<div style="width:50%">
    <img src="/posts/2021/2021-05-11-illustration-practice/images/after.png" />
</div>

After redrawing, I thought the reason why the sidetail hair wasn't look good were:

* There are a large area in this illustration, but it was too simple compared to others
* Towards edges of it, the shape looked too sharp and not unnatural flow from the root of it.

One tip: this is the 1st time for me to use a layer mask, which can be used to hide a part of a layer.
The clip studio paint account on a twitter said and explained about it on this [link](https://twitter.com/clipstudiopaint/status/1328161051083493376?lang=en).
I often delete the lines on the line layers to clean up but  I wanted to save those line information in order to recover it, and a layer mask can be used for this purpose.
But it requires modifying layer mask as well all the time, so I'll see how much it's useful and worth using it.
