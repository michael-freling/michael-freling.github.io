This is the note for my illustration as a beginner.

Today's painting

The next painting is the one I drew on this time.
Left painting is the one for a final painting, and right one is the one to edit.

Challenges

In this painting, I needed to figure out what is a good way to draw her with the reflection of lights from monitors in the dark room.
So, I tried to use a different Blending mode for light layers and see which one is good for them, not only for light reflectoins, but also colors in the room.
Before considering its background, I also drew colors, so put it for comparisons as well.

At the end, I decided to use Screen.
Note that I tried to change Blending mode before I cleaned up drawings, so details were different from the final painting.

Takeaways and challenges
===
- Blending mode:
    - Add (Grow), Glow Dodge, Color Dodge: Can be used to draw something shines by themselves.
	- Screen: Can be used to draw something to be lit up by lights
	- Others: I'm not sure how can I use them

Also, these are different topics but there were a few things to note
- Use thicker lines to fill the colors easily without paiting the colors beyond the lines
- I couldn't figure out how to draw texts rotation for 3D dimension
