Voice changer
---

Voice changers might be helpful to change voices and record voices for animations.

The software that can change both of pitch and formant is better to change a human's voice than others.

- [Koigoe](http://koigoemoe.g2.xrea.com/koigoe/koigoe.html)
    - Pitch and formant can be changed manually
    - Japanese language has to be installed in Windows
- [Rovee](https://www.kvraudio.com/product/rovee-by-g200kg)
    - This is a VST plugin and this may need to use a VST Host application. I couldn't use some applications for this plugin probably because this plugin is old.
- [Gachikoe! Core](https://booth.pm/en/items/1236505)
- [バ美声](https://booth.pm/en/items/3432497)


There are some articles to introduce the above voice changers. For example,

- [How to use Voice Changer software effectively](https://eirifu.wordpress.com/2020/05/13/how-to-use-voice-changer-software-effectively/)
- [(Japanese) [2021 latest version] Must-see for those who want to "Babiniku"! 9 free and paid standard voice changers](https://www.moguravr.com/voice-changer-selection/)
    - It requires to translate the article to read in English


There are tons of other voice changers, too. 
But it was hard to change a voice because most of them supports only changing a pitch and not formant, and a voice becomes just like a robot.

- [Graillon 2](https://www.auburnsounds.com/products/Graillon.html)
- [MORPHVOX Pro](https://screamingbee.com/morphvox-voice-changer): I haven't tried this
- [Animaze](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1364390/Animaze_by_FaceRig/)
- [Voxal](https://voxal-voice-changer.en.uptodown.com/windows): 
- [Voicemod](https://www.voicemod.net/)


There are some articles or videos to introduce some voice changers, for example,

For VST plugins, there are other plugins so that we can use to get some effects, like a noise reduction.
