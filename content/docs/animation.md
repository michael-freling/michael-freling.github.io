### Voice changer

Voice changers might be helpful to change voices and record voices for animations.

The software that can change both of pitch and formant is better to change a human's voice than others.

- [Koigoe](http://koigoemoe.g2.xrea.com/koigoe/koigoe.html)
    - Pitch and formant can be changed manually
- [Rovee](https://www.kvraudio.com/product/rovee-by-g200kg)
    - This is a VST plugin and this may need to use a VST Host application. I couldn't use some applications for this plugin probably because this plugin is old.

There are some articles to introduce the above voice changers. For example,

- [How to use Voice Changer software effectively](https://eirifu.wordpress.com/2020/05/13/how-to-use-voice-changer-software-effectively/)
- [(Japanese) [2021 latest version] Must-see for those who want to "Babiniku"! 9 free and paid standard voice changers](https://www.moguravr.com/voice-changer-selection/)
    - It requires to translate the article to read in English


There are tons of other voice changers, too. 
But it was hard to change a voice because most of them supports only changing a pitch and not formant, and a voice becomes just like a robot.
